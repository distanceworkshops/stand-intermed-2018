# We've spent all day talking about R

- Many people do distance sampling analyses in Distance
- Windows GUI program
- Developed at St Andrews since 1997
- Easy to start but harder for more complicated projects

# Distance is bad at some things

- Fiddly to do GIS stuff
- Spatial modelling is hard, Distance doesn't have all the tools
- Writing a lot of models can be time consuming

---

# R is good

- Easy to investigate more complicated models
- Audit of what you did
- Reproducible analyses

# How do we get there from here?

---

# `readdst`

- R package to automatically convert Distance projects
- Distance projects are just an Access database
- "Frees" your data from the format and converts models

---

# A quick example

```{r}
project_file <- system.file("Golftees-example", package="readdst")
project_file <- paste0(project_file,"/Golftees")
```
```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(readdst)
converted <- convert_project(project_file)
```

---

# What's in that?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
converted
```

---

# Let's run an analysis

```{r, echo=TRUE}
analysis_1 <- run_analysis(converted[[1]])
summary(analysis_1)
```

---

# Oh our data is there too!

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ls(converted[[1]]$env)
```

(an *environment*)

---

# The data

```{r, echo=TRUE}
head(converted[[1]]$env$data)
```

---

# Checking results


```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
test_stats(converted[[1]])
```

```{r}
print(test_stats(converted[[1]]), digits=4)
```

---

# Recap

- Distance can be a great way to start an analysis
- More complicated stuff can be easier in R
- `readdst` does the conversion for you
- Checks results in case there are differences
